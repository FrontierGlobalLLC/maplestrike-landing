						<b>Your Data</b>
					</h3>
					<p>
						Whilst using our services, we may ask you to provide us with certain personally identifiable information that can, should we choose, be utilised to contact you, identify you, or differentiate you from other users.
					</p>
					<p>
						Your personally identifiable information (herein referred to as “personal information”) includes, but is not limited to, your name, email address, phone number and postal address. Any personal information you provide to CitrusNode will not be given to any outside parties unless stated below, unless we receive a subpoena from the court.
					</p>              
					<h3>
						<b>Collection of Data Provided to Us</b>
					</h3>
					<p>
						CitrusNode collects various personal information which you will provide to us via the client panel on the signup of an account. Once you have provided such personal information, it will be stored securely on our servers for use by the CitrusNode team.
					</p>
					<p>
						Our website also utilises several third-party services to operate an efficient service. This includes, but is not limited to; Tawk.to, Google, Font Awesome, WHMCS, Trustpilot and Discord. Should you have any queries about the collection and use of data by these services, you should refer to their individual privacy policies. We do not have any control over, and assume no responsibility for the privacy policies, use of data, content, or practices of any third-party service providers. We also do not hold any influence over these websites or services.
					</p>          
					<h3>
						<b>Collection of Data Automatically via Cookies </b>
					</h3>
					<p>
						In addition to the listed personal information, we also collect cookies and usage data to track the activity on our server. Cookies are small files containing data which may, on occasion, include anonymous unique identifiers. Cookies are sent to your browser from a particular website and stored on your device. However, you may instruct your browser to refuse all cookies being sent, or to indicate when an individual cookie is being sent and provide you with a choice as to whether to accept or decline the cookies. However, should you decline these cookies, you may be prevented from accessing certain sections of our website and service.
					</p>
					<p>
						We utilise session cookies to operate our service, preference cookies to remember your preferences and various other settings, and security cookies for a range of individual security purposes.
					</p>
					<h3>
						<b>Use of Data</b>
					</h3>
					<p>
						 CitrusNode utilises the data it collects for a variety of purposes. This includes, but is not limited to, providing, and maintaining the service, notifying you about the changes to our service, allowing you to participate in interactive features of our website, providing customer service, providing analysis and other valuable information with the view of improving the service, monitoring the usage of the service, and to detect and address technical issues. 
					</p>
					<p>
						 We will never use your data to make a sale to a third-party service provider, nor will we use your personal information to hold leverage or negotiating power over a competitor service or other services. 
					</p>   
					<h3>
						<b>Security</b>
					</h3>
					<p>
						 CitrusNode takes precautions to protect your information. When you submit sensitive information via the website, your information is protected both online and offline. Wherever we collect sensitive information (e.g. credit card information), that information is encrypted and transmitted to us in a secure way. You can verify this by looking for a lock icon in the address bar and looking for "https" at the beginning of the address of the webpage.
					</p>
					<p>
						 While we use encryption to protect sensitive information transmitted online, we also protect your information offline. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job (for example, billing or customer service) are granted access to personally identifiable information. The computers and servers in which we store personally identifiable information are kept in a secure environment. This is all done to prevent any loss, misuse, unauthorized access, disclosure or modification of the user's personal information under our control.
					</p>            
					<p>
						 The company also uses Secure Socket Layer (SSL) for authentication and private communications to build users' trust and confidence in the internet and website use by providing simple and secure access and communication of credit card and personal information.
					</p>     
					<h3>
						<b>Transfer of Data</b>
					</h3>
					<p>
						 Your personal information as outlined above may be transferred to, or maintained on, servers located outside of your state, province, country, or other governmental jurisdiction where data protection laws differ from your jurisdiction. In line with our <a href="./terms-of-service">Terms of Service</a>, your data will be processed in line with the jurisdiction that governs CitrusNode. Please see our <a href="./terms-of-service">Terms of Service</a> for further details. 
					</p>
					<p>
						 CitrusNode will take the necessary steps to ensure that your data is transferred securely. Appropriate due diligence will be carried out on any organisation or nation where your data is being transferred to, before such a transfer takes place. This due diligence will include an assessment regarding the controls and security in place to protect your data following the transfer.
					</p>                
					<h3>
						<b>Disclosure of Data</b>
					</h3>
					<p>
						 We may choose, at our discretion, to disclose your personal data where we believe circumstances arise that deem disclosure necessary. Disclosure may happen under the following listed circumstances, but the circumstances for disclosure may arise outside of such circumstances.
					</p>
					<p>
						 We will disclose your data to comply with a legal obligation, protect against legal liability, protect, and defend the rights, security and property of CitrusNode, or another clients/the public. In addition, we actively investigate wrongdoing connected to CitrusNode, and as such, the disclosure of your personal data may be necessary to fulfil this purpose.           
					</p>    
					<h3>
						<b>Removal of Data</b>
					</h3>
					<p>
						 Under the Privacy Act, you, in your capacity as the visitor, viewer, customer/consumer, etc, have the right to access, amend or request the removal of your personal information stored by CitrusNode following your submission.
					</p>
					<p>
						 Upon receipt of a written request and an adequate amount of primary information to successfully identify the requesting party, we will decide in line with the clauses as outlined within the Privacy Act.          
					</p>       
					<p>
						 Once your information is removed, we will not be able to retrieve your information.         
					</p>  
					<h3>

						 By using this website, you are hereby accepting the terms and conditions stipulated within the Privacy Policy Agreement.
