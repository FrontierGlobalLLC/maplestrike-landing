					<h3>
						<b>Security</b>
					</h3>
					<p>
						 You must not share your account details with any other individual or organisation. As you are prevented from sharing account details, Maplestrike will hold you responsible for any actions carried out by your account that violates the TOS. As a result, you will be penalised for any violations caused by your account.
					</p>
					<p>
						 If your account has been breached but you fail to report it to Maplestrike, we may suspend or terminate your service and bar you from ordering services from Maplestrike in the indefinite future. Further, you must not use your services to exploit flaws in Maplestrike’s software or hardware, or the software or hardware of other internet services.       
					</p>       
					<p>
						 All flaws and potential exploits within Maplestrike’s hardware or software must be reported via a ticket in the billing panel upon discovery.     
					</p>  
					<h3>
						<b>Payment</b>
					</h3>
					<p>
						Your services will not be activated by Maplestrike until the first payment is successfully received by us. Further, if you do not renew your service before the stated expiration date, your service will be suspended automatically until a payment is made. Following thirty (30) days without payment, your service will be terminated, and all the associated files will be removed from our servers. 
					</p>            
					<h3>
						<b>Refund Policy</b>
					</h3>
					<p>
						 All refund requests must be made via a ticket on our billing panel. When requesting such a refund, you must be logged into the appropriate client account. Failure to log into your client account when submitting a refund request will result in the request being denied on security grounds. Our support team will then ask you to login and resubmit the request, granting you an additional 24 hours to do so.
					</p>           
					<p>
						 Payments for the renewal of a service, addons for services you purchase, and management packs cannot be refunded under any circumstances. Account credits are non-refundable and non-withdrawable.
					</p>            
					<p>
						 All refunds will be provided as Maplestrike credit or sent via the original payment method. This is at the discretion of our support team or management team. Upon the refund of a payment, all related services will be immediately terminated, and the associated files removed from our servers.
					</p>           
					<p>
						 Subject to the various conditions below, Maplestrike can provide a refund within the first twenty-four ("24") hours of ordering a new service.
					</p>  
					<p>
						 Refunds for services are available within the first twenty-four ("24") hours of a monthly or quarterly plan commencing. The twenty-four ("24") hour time period commences at the time of order and ceases when the cancellation request is submitted. Beyond this period, refunds are given solely at our discretion. Upon submitting a refund request, our support team may seek to assist you in solving any issues you have with the service before issuing a refund. You are required to submit a valid reason for the refund request, although the reason provided does not affect your eligibility to claim a refund under this policy.
					</p>  
					<p>
						 When our support team receives a refund request, they will seek confirmation from yourself to process the refund before it is issued. If you fail to confirm your continued desire to seek a refund within fourty-eight ("48") hours of our communication, you will no longer be able to request a refund under this policy.
					</p>     
					<p>
						 This policy only covers the first twenty-four ("24") hours after a new service commences and is only extended to a single transaction per client account. Further payments to renew, upgrade or purchase add-ons for the existing service are not eligible under this policy.
					</p>    
					<p>
						 Chargebacks or payment disputes on any payment processor or platform will result in a loss of eligibility for a refund under this policy.
					</p>    
					<p>
						 Should you retract a refund request or fail to confirm such a request, the request will be treated as void and no refund will be issued. A new refund request can be submitted following this but will be treated independently of the void request and will follow the terms as outlined above.
					</p>       
					<p>
						 Clients who are found to be creating multiple client accounts to claim a refund under this policy will be automatically excluded from the policy.
					</p>  
					<h3>
						<b>Disputes</b>
					</h3>
					<p>
						Chargebacks or payment disputes on any payment processor or platform will result in an immediate account suspension, including the suspension of all your Maplestrike services. Should a dispute be opened on any payment, refunds will be provided at the discretion of our staff in line with our refunds policy.
					</p>                
					<h3>
						<b>Fraudulency</b>
					</h3>
					<p>
						“Fraudulency” or “Fraudulent Activity” within the Provider’s network, on its services or by unauthorized utilization of its property is prohibited. Fraudulency may be described as anything of the Provider word but is generally a form of utilization which is illicit, illegal and/or made with bad intent and or faith.
					</p>
					<p>
						The services are provided for their described utilization purpose, one shall only utilize said service for said purpose, and shall not in any case attempt to utilize the services for Fraudulent Activities.
					</p>                 
					<h3>						
						<b>Overpayments</b>
					</h3>
					<p>
						Maplestrike understands and accepts that overpayments and accidental payments can occur, and we will work with you constructively to rectify the issue.
					</p>   
					<p>
						A payment made by the user is not an “accidental” payment, and a refund of this type is subject to the conditions under the “Refund Policy”.
					</p>      
					<p>
						We will treat a payment as accidental when a payment is made by a client, but where the payment was not due nor requested by Maplestrike. If the client completed a payment multiple times for the same invoice or service, we would treat this as an overpayment and work with you to rectify this.
					</p>    
					<p>
						Following an overpayment or accidental payment, a refund can be offered to you under certain conditions. The refund request must be made via a ticket from a logged-in account in our billing panel. The request must be made within seven ("7") days of an overpayment or accidental payment. Overpayments are automatically converted into credits by our system, so we cannot offer refunds where you have already used the automatic credits. Should multiple overpayments have been made, only payments made within the past thirty ("30") days at the time of the ticket being handled by our support team can be refunded.
					</p>     
					<p>
						When requesting a refund for an overpayment or accidental payment, please ensure that you make clear the payment method used to make the overpayment/accidental payment, as well as the date that the payment was processed.
					</p>  
					<h3>
						<b>Cancellations</b>
					</h3>
					<p>
						If you no longer wish to continue your service, you must submit a formal cancellation request for the service in the client area.
					</p>     
					<p>
						As we do not have access to the client's PayPal account, we can not and will not be responsible for any incidental payments made from using the automatic payment subscription service.
					</p>  
					<h3>
						<b>Affiliates</b>
					</h3>
					<p>
						Affiliate financial withdrawals can be made by any of our supported payment methods (including account credit). You must not click your own affiliate link to increase your credit balance.
					</p>     
					<p>
						Advertising your affiliate link on websites is only permitted if the website requires user registration and displays that the author or user who posted the affiliate link is yourself.
					</p>       
					<p>
						We may, at any time, investigate your affiliate account to ensure all terms outlined are being followed. This may include asking you various questions which require an answer from yourself before a withdrawal is permitted. Failure to answer these questions, or should you provide incorrect/untruthful answers, may result in the removal of your affiliate account and/or the closure of your affiliate account.
					</p>     
					<p>
						Any attempts to exploit the affiliate system or violate these terms may result in the removal of your affiliate balance, your eligibility to withdraw your affiliate balance, and/or the closure of your account.
					</p>  
					<h3>
